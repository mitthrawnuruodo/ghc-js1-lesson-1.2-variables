# JavaScript 1 Lesson 1.2: Variables - strings, numbers and booleans

## Exercises for Programming Foundations Lesson 2

Load the index.html file in your browser locally, and open the Console.

Make sure you see the "script.js is connected" logged in Console.

## Exercise 1
Make a new variable named `firstName` and assign it with a string with the value of your first name(s).

Make another new variable named `lastName` and assign it with  a string with the value of your last name(s).

Console log out your full name.

## Exercise 2
Make a new variable `x` with the numeric value of 19.
Make a new variable `y` with the numeric value of 23.

Add `x` and `y` into another variable named `answer`.

Console log out the value of `answer`.

## Exercise 3
Make a new variable named `myBool` without assigning it a value.

Console log out the value of `myBool`. What result do you expect it to have?

Assign the value `true` to `myBool`.

Again, console log out the value of `myBool`. What result did you expect it to have now?

What is the result of the following, and why:
```js
console.log(!myBool);
```

## Exercise 4
Make a new apropriately named variable with the string "Blåbærsyltetøy".

Console log out the number of characters in that string.

## Exercise 5
Make a variable `a` with the string value `"19"`, and a variable `b` with the numeric value `23`.

Console log out `(a + b)`. What result do you get?

Without changing `a` or `b`, what do you need to do to get the result to be 42?

## Exercise 6
Make the variables x = 19, y = 23, and z = 10.

Console log out (x + y * z). Did you get the result you expected?

How must you place parenthesis in the expression (x + y * z) to get the result 420, instead?

## Exercise 7
Console log out the reminder you get when dividing 7 by 3.
